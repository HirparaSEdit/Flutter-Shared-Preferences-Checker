A new Flutter project.

Project Title: Flutter Shared Preferences Checker

Description:

The Flutter Shared Preferences Checker is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart. This project showcases the implementation of a basic authentication system along with the utilization of Flutter's shared preferences for data persistence.

Key Features:

Splash Screen: The application starts with an engaging splash screen, providing a visually appealing introduction to the user.

Login Page: Users can securely log in using their credentials. The login system is designed to remember user sessions, allowing for seamless app usage.

Shared Preferences Verification: The app includes a robust mechanism for verifying the functionality of Flutter's shared preferences. It demonstrates that once a user logs in, the application retains their session, preventing the need to re-authenticate upon app restart.

Logout Functionality: Users have the option to log out, which resets the session. Upon restarting the app after logging out, the login page will be presented again, ensuring enhanced security and privacy.

How It Works:

Upon successful login, user credentials are stored in shared preferences.
The app checks for existing session data upon restart. If found, it bypasses the login page.
Logging out clears the session, requiring re-authentication upon app restart.
Project Goal:

The primary objective of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of secure authentication and session management using Flutter and Dart. By employing shared preferences, the app ensures a seamless user experience while prioritizing data privacy.

Note: The app's functionality may vary based on the specific platform and device configurations.
